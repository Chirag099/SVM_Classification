# SVM_Classification
A kernel is a function used in SVM for helping to solve problems. With the help of kernel we can go to higher dimensions and perform smooth calculations.
We can go up to an infinite number of dimensions using kernels. Kernel plays a vital role in classification and is used to analyze some patterns in the given dataset.
In this Dataset we have used various kernel form of SVM Model to check for the accuracy and higher efficiency.
